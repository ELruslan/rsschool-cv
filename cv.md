About Me
--------

For a long time he worked as a service center engineer. He was engaged
in the repair of digital equipment. Even at the university it was
interesting to write websites. After university, I worked as an engineer
and at the same time went to HTML and CSS courses. 3 months of study, I
didn't really learn anything new. As a result, I decided to open my own
service center. I worked for 5 years and decided to close down and try
my hand at the front-end. I am fond of valeyball. Active rest, jogging
in the forest.

Example Code
------------

``` {style="color:#d1d1d1;background:#000000;"}
function getMatrix(number) {
                        // good luck
                        let arr=[];
                          for(let i = 0; i < number; i++){
                            arr[i]=[];
                            for(let j = 0; j < number; j++){
                              arr[i].push(0);
                          }
                            arr[i][i] = 1;
                          
                        }
                        return arr;
                      }
